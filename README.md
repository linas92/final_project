# final_project

1. Make a plan
2. Achieve greatness
3. Win life

# <h1><b><i>Dungeons and Dragons Monster Library</i></b></h1>

1. Create a base project
2. Think of and make the database connections (with dbdesigner or w/e)
3. Use ptu5_library app as reference and keep up the work
4. Inject more CSS to make the website look pretty.

My day2day plan is on my white-board, so I wont bother writing everything here.

# How and why this will work:
All DnD Monsters have classes, features, races, abilities and so on. I can and will categorise them. That's why it will be easier to "class" them and make libraries out of and for them. I believe this is a great idea! There are too few websites with clasified dnd monsters. As a "Game-master" myself, I believe the sole usability for this will be focused towards dungeon masters. Of course people, or should I say players of this game will also want to see whats this all about. All the wondering minds who are curious about all this "dnd stuff" will be welcome here. <i>I will be focusing on pathfinder version of the dungeons and dragons.</i>
