# <h1><b><i>Dungeons and Dragons Monster Library</i></b></h1>


# How and why this will work:
All DnD Monsters have classes, features, races, abilities and so on. I can and will categorise them. That's why it will be easier to "class" them and make libraries out of and for them. I believe this is a great idea! There are too few websites with clasified dnd monsters. It's like a facebook for DnD monsters. As a "Game-master" and a DnD player myself, I believe the sole usability for this will be focused towards dungeon masters. Of course people, or should I say players of this game will also want to see whats this all about. All the wondering minds who are curious about all this "dnd stuff" will be welcome here. <i>I will be focusing on pathfinder version of the dungeons and dragons.</i>
